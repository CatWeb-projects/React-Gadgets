It's very important when all team use a unique style code. That's why we use Prietter and ESLint. We insist that you use them also in your feature projects. The test it's not complicated, but you have to figure out how it works, helps and how to configure it.

Todo:
Create react application using create-react-app
Add eslint and eslint-config-airbnb
Add prettier and create prettier config (.prettierrc)
Add husky and lint-staged libraries

Check list:
The project created via create-react-app
The project has eslint and eslint-config-airbnb
The project has prietter and its rules in project
The project uses husky and lint-staged
The project automatically format code using prietter and fix code using eslint on git commit
